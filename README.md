# Final

    My Client and I worked together to make this website. He wanted a webiste that was informational but not too complicated. He wanted it to show off some of their work to get a little insight into what they do at CSG. We should both locations but wanted to focus on our location. Overall the website was supposed to have a good flow and be easy to read without too much overload while tryign to read it.
